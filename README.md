# GenerateDocumentationComments
A Visual Studio extension for generating C# documentation comments

At this time, boilerplate summary documentation comments are added to public, protected,
and internal class declarations when the Tools->Invoke GenerateDocumentationCommentsInEditor
menu item is selected.

I blog about this extension. See the following posts for information about this extension:

1. [I Was Doing It All Wrong, And How I Changed To Doing It Right!](
https://jaipblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/15/i-was-doing-it-all-wrong-and-how-i-changed-to-doing-it-right/)
defines an initial set of user stories and a set of 9 unit tests for adding summary documentation
comments for class declarations.
2. Creating A Documentation Comment Generator For C#: High-Level Design Decisions (to be published)
discusses various ways of triggering the generation of boilerplate documentation comments.

Future posts will be used to extend the discussion.
